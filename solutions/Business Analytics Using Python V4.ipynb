Inside the square brackets are numbers representing the sequence in which code is executed.  The numbers will vary, and even be out of order, if a code cell is executed several times but a following code cell is not reexecuted.  The sequencing numbers can be reset by rerunning the kernel.  This is done by clicking on *Kernel* on the main toolbar and selecting *Restart & Run All*.  \n",

Its strength, adhered to by Python programers, is a coding format that emphasizes readable code.  Indentation is the primary way to accomplish this.  Also, its strength is based on a very wide array of *packages* or *modules* or *libraries*.  Packages perform analysis or data manipulation operations.  There are many packages, each one providing a special set of analysis tools so a package can be viewed as a container of functions.  Sometimes a package contains smaller, more specialized packages so a grand package could be a container for smaller ones.  You will see how to access and use packages and subset packages in this and other lessons.\n",

Statsmodels has an array of statistical modeling functions, only a few of which will be used in these lessons.  Numpy and Matplotlib are base packages for Pandas, Seaborn, and Statsmodels.
